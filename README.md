# Project Luther: Summer Blockbusters and the Actors in Them
Within you'll find notebooks and serialized files in support of a data science project. I scraped BoxOfficeMojo and IMDB to find information about summer blockuster movies and the actors in them, to see if there was a relationship between total domestic gross and number of famous actors/what types of actors a movie employs. 

Check out my [MVP](https://github.com/suddensleep/luther/blob/master/MVP.md) and my [final presentation](./Project_Luther.pdf).
