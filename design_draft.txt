Question/need: 
How many superstars does your summer blockbuster need?
or
Can we predict total gross revenue of a summer blockbuster as a 
function of number of high-profile stars in the movie?

Description of my sample of movies and/or other data: 
The sample of movies I'll be using is the group of "summer blockbusters" 
from the past ten years. This will be defined as the top N high-grossing 
movies (where N is to be determined) between June 1 and September 1 of 
each year. 

Characteristics of each movie and/or other entities:
The other data I'll be considering will be the number of high-profile 
actors and actresses in each of these movies. I define a "high-profile" 
star as a star whose total gross box office pull (over all movies)is in 
the top M of all movie stars (where M is to be determined).
